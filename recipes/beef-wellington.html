 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>This is a delectable recipe to include around Christmas time. A beautiful piece of roast, a layer of premium mushroom. 
    and on top, beautiful pastry crust cut to form a decorative layer. It will take a few hours to cook, but it is so worth it. 
    Be careful, I think your family will be begging you to make it every year.

 <ul>
    <li>2 x 400g beef fillets</li>
    <li>Olive oil, for frying</li>
    <li>500g ixture of wild mushrooms, cleaned</li>
    <li>1 thyme sprig, leaves only</li>
    <li>500g puff pastry</li>
    <li>8 slices of Parma ham</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks, beaten with 1 tbsp water and a pinch of salt</li>
    <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
 </ul>
 <ol>
    <li>Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of cling film to set it's shape, then chill overnight.</li>
    <li>Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a hot pan with a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until
        browned all over and rare in the middle. Remove from the pan and leave to cool.</li>
    <li>Finely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the thyme leaves and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to
        release their juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left
        with a mushroom paste (known as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.</li>
    <li>Cut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets.
        Chill in the refrigerator. </li>
    <li>Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a
        square. Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.</li>
    <li>Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then
        roll and tie the cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other beef fillet, then chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the
        pastry and brush all over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>When you are ready to cook the beef wellingtons, score the pastry lightly and brush with the egg wash again, then bake at 200Â°C/Gas 6
        for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and cooked. Rest for 10 minutes before carving.</li>
